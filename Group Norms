🧭 Group Norms

These norms ensure smooth communication, clear responsibilities, and respectful teamwork throughout our project.

🗣️ 1. Communication

Primary Channel:
Use one main platform for all project discussions (e.g., Viber, Slack, Discord, or a Messenger group) to prevent lost messages.

Response Time:
Everyone should check and reply to messages within 12–24 hours on weekdays.

🧑‍💻 2. Meetings

Regular Check-ins:
Hold two short meetings per week:

One to plan weekly tasks.

One to review progress and solve problems.

Have an Agenda:
Before each meeting, the meeting leader should prepare 2–3 bullet points to keep discussions focused.

End with Action Items:
Conclude each meeting by clearly stating who is responsible for what and the corresponding deadlines.

🧩 3. Task Management & Workload

Use a Task Board:
Use a simple tool like Trello, Asana, or a shared Google Sheet with columns such as To Do, In Progress, and Done.

Break Down Tasks:
Avoid big, vague tasks like “Build the app.” Instead, split them into smaller ones such as:

“Load CSV data”

“Create function to filter recipes”

“Add button to UI”

Assign Owners:
Each task must have one assigned owner to ensure clear accountability.

Be Honest About Time:
Communicate early if you’re busy. It’s better to say “I can only work 5 hours this week” than to miss a deadline unexpectedly.

💻 4. Code & Version Control

Use Git/GitHub from Day 1:
Create a shared repository. Everyone should learn the basics of clone, add, commit, push, and pull.

Alternatively, Google Colab can be used for simpler collaboration.

Coding Style:
Use a formatter such as Black (for Python) to keep code consistent and readable.

Comment Your Code:
Write simple comments explaining why something is done, especially for complex parts of the code.

⚖️ 5. Decision-Making & Conflict Resolution

Discuss, Then Decide:
For important decisions, discuss pros and cons as a team. If no consensus is reached, take a majority vote.

Address Problems Respectfully:
If someone isn’t completing their work, reach out privately and kindly:

“Hey, just checking in on the ingredient parsing task. Is everything going okay?”

Assume Good Intentions:
Always assume teammates are doing their best. Misunderstandings happen — ask questions before making accusations.
